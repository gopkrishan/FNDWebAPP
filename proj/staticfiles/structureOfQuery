Subsequently, Fadnavis on Friday announced a further cut in diesel prices by Rs 1.56 per litre in the state. The diesel consumers in the state will, therefore, get a total relief of Rs 4.06 per litre as the Centre has already reduced the prices on the fuel by Rs 2.50 per litre.\n\nCurrently Maharashtra government charges a 24% VAT and Rs 1 as surcharge on the base price of diesel in eight cities and within others it charges 21% VAT and Rs 1 as surcharge.\n\nIn Mumbai, there are more than 200 pumps and they witnessed a huge rush after the price cuts, said a petrol dealer.',

Mumbai, on the other hand, has the highest sales tax or VAT.\n\nFuel prices continue to soar across the country, pushing the petrol price in Mumbai today past the Rs 90 per litre mark. A litre of petrol in Mumbai costs Rs 90.08, while the price in Delhi is Rs 82.72. Diesel, meanwhile, is being sold at Rs 78.58 per litre in Mumbai and Rs 74.02 per litre in Delhi. In Patna, petrol is priced at Rs 91.96/litre -one among the highest in the country -- and diesel at Rs 79.68/litre.\n\nAccording to Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the largest fuel retailer in India, petrol is retailing at Rs 83.37/litre in Bengaluru, Rs 82.14/litre in Lucknow, Rs 84.54/ litre in Kolkata, Rs 87.70/litre in Hyderabad, Rs 85.17/litre in Guwahati and 85.99/litre in Chennai.

Mumbai, on the other hand, has the highest sales tax or VAT. Maharashtra levies 25 per cent value-added tax (VAT) on petrol in Mumbai, in addition to a surcharge of Rs 9 for a litre across the state. For diesel, the VAT is 21 per cent in Mumbai, with a surcharge of Rs 1 for a litre across the state. Last week petrol price breached the 90 rupees mark in ten districts across Maharashtra.\n\nWhile the Opposition has blamed the Union government for not taking enough measures to keep a tab on prices, the latter has maintained that global crude oil prices and other international factors are causing a hike in prices of fuel. The government has also ruled out any immediate reduction in excise duty in order to bring down the retail prices of auto fuels, and instead urged the states to take action - cut VAT on fuel.\n\nMust Watch Kareena Kapoor Khan Talks to Priyanka Sinha Jha on Feminism, Gender Equality & More Indians drive immigration growth in US: News in numbers Violence for anything including cow should be punished: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat Apple iOS 12 is now out: The top features to keep in mind", 'title': 'Fuel price hike: Petrol price crosses Rs 90 mark in Mumbai, costs Rs 91.96/litre in Patna today', 'wgt': 3, 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/article/business/commodities/fuel-price-hike-petrol-price-crosses-rs-90-mark-in-mumbai-costs-rs-91-96-litre-in-patna-today-5371318/', 'dataType': 'news', 'eventUri': 'eng-4288524', 'date': '2018-09-24'}
